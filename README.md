This is an R studio project repository. 

This repository collects any computational work associated with understanding effects to bull trout from drawdowns of the Rimrock Resevoir. It supports s7 consultations, recovery projects and general questions about ecology, climate and water management. Most of the work is just for note-taking or exploring ideas, not to be shared widely or to draw strong conclusions from.
